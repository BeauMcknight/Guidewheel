This repository showcases one of my key projects completed as part of my Technical Design Certificate – a **fully documented Guide Wheel Assembly**, including both **detailed part drawings** and a complete **assembly drawing**.

## 📄 Project Overview

This mechanical design project involved producing high-quality, industry-standard engineering drawings using CAD software. The project demonstrates:

- Proficiency in **technical drawing standards**
- Knowledge of **engineering tolerances and fits**
- Understanding of **part-to-part relationships in mechanical assemblies**
- Ability to produce **detailed, multi-view orthographic drawings**
- Experience creating **BOMs (Bills of Materials)** and **exploded views**

## 📁 Included Files

- **Guide Wheel Assembly Drawing.pdf**  
  - Exploded view of the full assembly  
  - Parts list (BOM) including materials and standards (e.g. ANSI B18 fasteners)  
  - Isometric and orthographic views  
  - Full tolerancing and dimensioning  
  - Projection: Third angle  
  - Date: 29/03/2023

- **Guide Wheel Detail Drawings.pdf**  
  - Individual component drawings: Base, Spindle, Bracket, Bush (Bronze), Roller, Special Washer  
  - Each with multiple views and full dimensioning  
  - Material specifications and machining symbols  
  - Date: 20/03/2023

## ⚙️ Skills Demonstrated

- CAD proficiency (Inventor/Fusion/AutoCAD-style platforms)
- Technical drawing and GD&T (Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing)
- Engineering standards and drawing conventions
- Mechanical component design and detailing
- Document control and versioning

## 📌 Competency Unit

**MEM30032A – Produce Basic Engineering Drawings**  
(Aligned with Australian training package requirements)

## 👨‍💼 Why This Matters

This project reflects my capability to work to industry standards and produce professional engineering documentation. It also illustrates my attention to detail and ability to clearly communicate design intent – essential skills for roles in **mechanical, manufacturing, or mechatronic engineering**.
